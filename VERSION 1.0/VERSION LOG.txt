Started at 10 am and finished 14 hours later at midnight.

It was just shy of 500 lines at some point.

Off the wim of a suggestion from Mr. Webb a coding class teacher.

Terrible code, not clean at all, very repetative.

Suprisingly good error handling throughout the session.

Almost all intended functionality is working.
